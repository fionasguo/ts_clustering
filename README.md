# Learning User Embeddings Through User Post Timelines

This is a method to learn user embeddings through users' timelines. We extract various texual features from users' posts to construct time series, and use a Transformer-based model to learn their embeddings.

These embeddings will enable us to better study the user population, for example through clustering into user subgroups, or performing similarity searches.
