Synthetic time series dataset with negative binomial distribution:

1. synthetic_data_X.pkl:
- simple 3 clusters
- 2 dimensions
- everyone in the same cluster respond to the same events (peaks align very well)
- same num of events and dates across dimensions

2. synthetic_data_simple_3c_2d_X.pkl:
- simple 3 clusters
- 2 dimensions
- everyone in the same cluster respond to the same events
- num events and dates vary across different dimensions

3. synthetic_data_noisy_3c_2d_X.pkl:
- 3 clusters
- 2 dimensions
- people in the same cluster do NOT respond to the same events
- num events and dates vary across different dimensions

4. synthetic_data_simple_10c_10d_X.pkl:
- 10 clusters
- 10 dimensions
- people in the same cluster respond to the same events
- num events and dates vary across different dimensions

5. synthetic_data_noisy_5c_10d_X.pkl:
- 5 clusters
- 10 dimensions
- people in the same cluster DO NOT respond to the same events
- num events and dates vary across different dimensions
